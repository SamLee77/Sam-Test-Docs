|  Symptoms  | Solution  |
| :----------| :---------| 
|I get a data extraction error message.| Create an extract of the data source by clicking on 'Activate Data Extract' in the message displayed. Save the workbook to Tableau Public. | 
|Canâ€™t login to Tableau Public with my Tableau.com account.| The login accounts for Tableau Public, the Tableau Community, and Tableau.com are not linked. You will have to create a new account for Tableau Public separately. | 
|Can't delete viz from Tableau Public server| In your profile page, hover over the thumbnail image of the viz you wish to delete, and click the little trash can icon. |
