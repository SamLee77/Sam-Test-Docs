|  Symptoms  | Solution  |
| :----------| :---------| 
|I get a data extraction error message when trying to save.| In your software taskbar, go to the Data tab and select and remove the dataset that is not "cleaned." Saving should now work.  | 
|Canâ€™t login to Tableau Public with my Tableau.com account.| The login accounts for Tableau Public, the Tableau Community, and Tableau.com are not linked. You will have to create a new account for Tableau Public separately. | 
|Can't delete viz from Tableau Public server.| In your profile page, hover over the viz image you wish to delete and click on the little trash can icon. |
|Can't connect data from Microsoft Access| This connection requires a driver and is only avialable on Windows OS at the moment. If the driver is not installed in your computer when you try to connect, Tableau will display an error message with a link where you can download the driver. |
|I am getting an error 403 when trying to visit the published site| Log out of the published website and clear your cookies. Refresh the webpage. |
