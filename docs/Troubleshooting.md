|  Symptoms  | Solution  |
| :----------| :---------| 
|I get a data extraction error message when trying to save.| In your software taskbar, go to the Data tab and select and remove the dataset that is not "cleaned." Saving should now work.  | 
|Canâ€™t login to Tableau Public with my Tableau.com account.| The login accounts for Tableau Public, the Tableau Community, and Tableau.com are not linked. You will have to create a new account for Tableau Public separately. | 
|Can't delete viz from Tableau Public server| In your profile page, hover over the viz image you wish to delete and click on the little trash can icon. |
